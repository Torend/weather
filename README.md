# Weather

Example URL: http://weather-env-1.eba-mmw6hdgd.eu-central-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/weather/data?lon=-179&lat=-90
Replace the input for latitude and longitude (following the equals signs)

## Things i would have optimized

Looking back i would have made the function that does the mathematical calculations for Min, Max, Avg more elegant. Maybe put it as a different file and then import it.

## Assumptions made

I renamed two columns within the CSV files to make it more conveniently fitting my schema.

## What would i add for it to be production service

I would have added more search criteria so the user could also filter results by date, etc. Also, I think more information and details about the weather could make the service more helpful for different use cases.
